#
# This is an example of a 'recipients' config file. To use one, set the
# 'recipients' config setting to this filepath, rather than a list of email
# addresses.
#
# This config gives more fine-grained control of who is emailed when a package
# is released, and all in one place (after all, you can override the setting
# 'config.plugins.release_hook.emailer.recipients' in any package.py as well).
#
# In this example:
# * An explicit list of packages email one address;
# * All packages with the attribute package_type='external', email another address;
# * All packages (regardless of whether they meet the above criteria) are sent
#   to another address.
#
# A mail will be sent to every address that matches the package being released.
#
# The 'filters' section performs simple value matching on the package's
# attributes. If the value given is a list, then the filter will match on any of
# the given values. If more than one attribute is listed under 'filters', then
# they are ANDed - ie all attributes must match. Only simple types (string, int)
# can be tested - testing any other attribute type will fail. If no attribute
# value is given (ie, its value is None), it will match if the attribute exists
# on the package, regardless of value.
#
# Note the lack of 'filters' in the last rule - this means the rule will match
# all packages.
