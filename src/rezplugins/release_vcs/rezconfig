git:
    # A list of branches that a user is allowed to rez release from.  This can 
    # be used to block releases from development or feature branches, and 
    # support a workflow such as 'gitflow'.  Each branch name should be a 
    # regular expression that can be used with re.match, for example '^master$'.
