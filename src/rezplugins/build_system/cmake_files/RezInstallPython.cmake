# except that it ensures that a python package is being used, and uses the appropriate python binary.
#
# Usage:
# rez_install_python(<label> FILES <py_files> [RELATIVE <rel_path>] DESTINATION <rel_install_dir>)

	# check that 'python' is in the environment. All 'python' packages should expose a 'rez-python'
	# binary (whether that be symlink/wrapper script etc), the following build command relies
	# on this, so that the correct version of the python interpreter is used to compile.
