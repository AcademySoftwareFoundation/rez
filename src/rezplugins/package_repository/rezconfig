    # The relative directory, under the repository location, where file locks
    # are created. You might need to use this option when file permissions are
    # locked down so that only certain users can release certain packages. In
    # this scenario, package releases may fail because a user with limited
    # permissions will fail to create the lockfile in the repository root. By
    # providing a subdirectory, you can open up the permissions on this
    # directory only. If null, lockfiles are left created in the root.

    # is False, because a lot of file stats are avoided.
