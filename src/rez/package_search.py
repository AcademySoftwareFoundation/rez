"""
Default algorithms for searching for packages based on some criteria. Package
repository plugins may implement these algorithms instead, because they may be
able to search packages much faster - for example, in a database-based package
repository. The algorithms here serve as backup for those package repositories
that do not provide an implementation.

    """Find packages that depend on the given package.

    This is a reverse dependency lookup. A tree is constructed, showing what
    packages depend on the given package, with an optional depth limit. A
    resolve does not occur. Only the latest version of each package is used,
    and requirements from all variants of that package are used.

    Args:
        package_name (str): Name of the package depended on.
        depth (int): Tree depth limit, unlimited if None.
        paths (list of str): paths to search for packages, defaults to
            `config.packages_path`.

    Returns:
        A 2-tuple:
        - (list of list of str): Lists of package names, where each list is a
          single depth in the tree. The first list is always [`package_name`].
        - `pygraph.digraph` object, where nodes are package names, and
          `package_name` is always the leaf node.
