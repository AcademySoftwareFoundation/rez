"""
Rez configuration settings. Do not change this file.

Settings are determined in the following way (higher number means higher
precedence):

1) The setting is first read from this file;
2) The setting is then overridden if it is present in another settings file
   pointed at by the $REZ_CONFIG_FILE environment variable;
3) The setting is further overriden if it is present in $HOME/.rezconfig;
4) The setting is overridden again if the environment variable $REZ_XXX is
   present, where XXX is the uppercase version of the setting key. For example,
   "image_viewer" will be overriden by $REZ_IMAGE_VIEWER. List values can be
   separated either with "," or blank space. Dict values are in the form
   "k1:v1,k2:v2,kn:vn";
5) The setting can also be overriden by the environment variable $REZ_XXX_JSON,
   and in this case the string is expected to be a JSON-encoded value;
6) This is a special case applied only during a package build or release. In
   this case, if the package definition file contains a "config" section,
   settings in this section will override all others.

Note that in the case of plugin settings (anything under the "plugins" section
of the config), (4) and (5) do not apply.

Variable expansion can be used in configuration settings. The following
expansions are supported:
- Any property of the system object: Eg "{system.platform}" (see system.py)
- Any environment variable: Eg "${HOME}"

The following variables are provided if you are using rezconfig.py files:
- 'rez_version': The current version of rez.

Paths should use the path separator appropriate for the operating system
(based on Python's os.path.sep).  So for Linux paths, / should be used. On
Windows \ (unescaped) should be used.

Note: The comments in this file are extracted and turned into Wiki content. Pay
attention to the comment formatting and follow the existing style closely.

# - version_priority: Prefer variants that contain higher versions of packages

#
#    rez-env foo bar
#
# ...then, in either variant_select_mode, it will prefer the first variant,
# ["bar-3.0", "baz-2.1"], because it has a higher version of the first variant
# requirement (bar). However, if we instead do:
#
#    rez-env foo bar burgle
#
# ...we get different behavior. version_priority mode will still return
# ["bar-3.0", "baz-2.1"], because the first requirement's version is higher.
#
# However, intersection_priority mode will pick the second variant,
# ["bar-2.8", "burgle-1.0"], because it contains more packages that were in the
# original request (burgle).

# Package filter. One or more filters can be listed, each with a list of
# exclusion and inclusion rules. These filters are applied to each package
# during a resolve, and if any filter excludes a package, that package is not
# included in the resolve. Here is a simple example:
#
#     package_filter:
#         excludes:
#         - glob(*.beta)
#         includes:
#         - glob(foo-*)
#
# This is an example of a single filter with one exclusion rule and one inclusion
# rule. The filter will ignore all packages with versions ending in '.beta',
# except for package 'foo' (which it will accept all versions of). A filter will
# only exclude a package iff that package matches at least one exclusion rule,
# and does not match any inclusion rule.
#
# Here is another example, which excludes all beta packages, and all packages
# except 'foo' that are released after a certain date. Note that in order to
# use multiple filters, you need to supply a list of dicts, rather than just a
# dict:
#
#     package_filter:
#     - excludes:
#       - glob(*.beta)
#     - excludes:
#       - after(1429830188)
#       includes:
#       - foo  # same as range(foo), same as glob(foo-*)
#
# This example shows why multiple filters are supported - with only one filter,
# it would not be possible to exclude all beta packages (including foo), but also
# exclude all packages after a certain date, except for foo.
#
# Following are examples of all the possible rules:
#
# example             | description
# --------------------|----------------------------------------------------
# glob(*.beta)        | Matches packages matching the glob pattern.
# regex(.*-\\.beta)   | Matches packages matching re-style regex.
# requirement(foo-5+) | Matches packages within the given requirement.
# before(1429830188)  | Matches packages released before the given date.
# after(1429830188)   | Matches packages released after the given date.

# foo-5+              | Same as range(foo-5+)

# Colorization
###############################################################################

# The following settings provide styling information for output to the console,
# and is based on the capabilities of the Colorama module
# (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama).
#
# *_fore and *_back colors are based on the colors supported by this module and
# the console. One or more styles can be applied using the *_styles
# configuration. These settings will also affect the logger used by rez.
#
# At the time of writing, valid values are:
# fore/back: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
# style: dim, normal, bright

# Enables/disables colorization globally.
#
# > [[media/icons/warning.png]] Note: Turned off for Windows currently as there seems
# > to be a problem with the Colorama module.
#
# May also set to the string "force", which will make rez output color styling
# information, even if the the output streams are not ttys. Useful if you are
# piping the output of rez, but will eventually be printing to a tty later.
# When force is used, will generally be set through an environment variable, eg:
#
#     echo $(REZ_COLOR_ENABLED=force python -c "from rez.utils.colorize import Printer, local; Printer()('foo', local)")

# Settings specific to certain plugin implementations can be found in the
# "rezconfig" file accompanying that plugin. The settings listed here are
# common to all plugins of that type.

plugins = {
    "release_vcs": {
        # Format string used to determine the VCS tag name when releasing. This
        # will be formatted using the package being released - any package
        # attribute can be referenced in this string, eg "{name}".
        #
        # It is not recommended to write only '{version}' to the tag. This will
        # cause problems if you ever store multiple packages within a single
        # repository - versions will clash and this will cause several problems.
        "tag_name": "{qualified_name}",

        # A list of branches that a user is allowed to rez-release from. This
        # can be used to block releases from development or feature branches,
        # and support a workflow such as "gitflow".  Each branch name should be
        # a regular expression that can be used with re.match(), for example
        # "^master$".
        "releasable_branches": [],

        # If True, a release will be cancelled if the repository has already been
        # tagged at the current package's version. Generally this is not needed,
        # because Rez won't re-release over the top of an already-released
        # package anyway (or more specifically, an already-released variant).
        #
        # However, it is useful to set this to True when packages are being
        # released in a multi-site scenario. Site A may have released package
        # foo-1.4, and for whatever reason this package hasn't been released at
        # site B. Site B may then make some changes to the foo project, and then
        # attempt to release a foo-1.4 that is now different to site A's foo-1.4.
        # By setting this check to True, this situation can be avoided (assuming
        # that both sites are sharing the same code repository).
        #
        # Bear in mind that even in the above scenario, there are still cases
        # where you may NOT want to check the tag. For example, an automated
        # service may be running that detects when a package is released at
        # site A, which then checks out the code at site B, and performs a
        # release there. In this case we know that the package is already released
        # at A, but that's ok because the package hasn't changed and we just want
        # to release it at B also. For this reason, you can set tag checking to
        # False both in the API and via an option on the rez-release tool.
        "check_tag": False
