This folder contains all the libraries on which rez depends to run.

The dependencies list found here is used to track which version we use so that when we
revisit the install procedure, it will be much simpler to do any change in the vendored
libraries (updating them, un-vendoring some, etc).

Note that the latest versions column is just to give us an idea of how far back we are.

NOTE: A port to redis may be a better option, people are more familiar with it and it already has a good python client that supports conn pooling.                                                                                                                                                     |

We might be able to achieve the same with pydot or graphviz (the pip package)?                                                                      |

Newer versions require >=2.1.4)                                                                                                       |

Updating would probably require quite a lot of work and wouldn't bring that much to rez.                                                                                                                      |

I guess if we want to support python 2 and 3 we will use it more and more.                                                                                                                  |

Updating would possibly give us some speed improvements.                                                                                                                                                        |
| version                     | ?                          |                                         | This is actually part of rez. It's here because I've been intending on releasing it separately for ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| yaml (PyYAML)               | 3.10 (May 30, 2011)        | 5.1 (Mar 13, 2019)                      | Not much changes, mostly broken releases that never made it. Between 3.10 and 5.1 there is only 3 versions that made it to the public (3.11 and 3.12, 3.13), the rest were all removed or marked as pre-release. It's safe to update. |


# Development

| Package   | Version              | Latest               | Note                                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| unittest2 | 0.5.1 (Jul 12, 2010) | 1.1.0 (Jun 30, 2015) | If we drop support for python 2.6, we will be able to use unittest from the std lib. Note: Can be done now, 2.6 already officially dropped. |
