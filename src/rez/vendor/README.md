This folder contains all the libraries on which rez depends to run.

Libraries that are required to install Rez can be found in [src/build_utils](../../build_utils).

The dependencies list found here is used to track which version we use so that when we
revisit the install procedure, it will be much simpler to do any change in the vendored
libraries (updating them, un-vendoring some, etc).

Note that the latest versions column is just to give us an idea of how far back we are.

| colorama                    | 0.3.1 (Apr 19, 2014)       | 0.4.1 (Nov 25, 2018)                    | The newest version probably support Windows :)                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If so, the latest version is 1.1.6 (May 15, 2016)                                                                                                                                       |

NOTE: A port to redis may be a better option, people are more familiar with it and it already has a good python client that supports conn pooling.
| packaging                    | 19.0 (Jan 20, 2019)         | 19.0 (Jan 20, 2019)                       | Added (July 2019) to enable PEP440 compatible versions handling.

We might be able to achieve the same with pydot or graphviz (the pip package)?                                                                      |
| pyparsing                   | 2.4.0 (Apr 8, 2019)      | 2.4.0 (Apr 8, 2019)                     | ~~Transitive dependency. Required by pydot and version pydot 1.0.28 specifically require ==2.0.1. Newer versions require >=2.1.4)~~ Updated (July 2019) along with pydot to allow for packaging lib to be used.                                                                                                       |
| schema                      | 0.3.1 (Apr 28, 2014)       | 0.7.0 (Feb 27, 2019)                    | Our version is patched. Updating would probably require quite a lot of work and wouldn't bring that much to rez.                                                                                                                      |
| six                         | 1.12.0 (Dec 9, 2018)       | 1.12.0 (Dec 9, 2018)                    | Used only for its exec_ function for now. I guess if we want to support python 2 and 3 we will use it more and more. Updated (July 2019) to coincide with packaging lib addition that depends on it.                                                                                                                |

Updating would possibly give us some speed improvements.                                                                                                                                                        |

It's here because I've been intending on releasing it separately for ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
