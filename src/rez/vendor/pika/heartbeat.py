        # for broker heartbeats that may be right at the edge of the timeout
        # window. This is different behavior from the RabbitMQ Java client and
        # the spec that suggests a check interval equivalent to two times the
        # heartbeat timeout value. But, one advantage of adding a small amount
        # is that bad connections will be detected faster.
