Role
====

The ``PluginManager`` loads plugins that enforce the `Plugin
Description Policy`_, and offers the most simple methods to activate
and deactivate the plugins once they are loaded.

.. note:: It may also classify the plugins in various categories, but
          this behaviour is optional and if not specified elseway all
          plugins are stored in the same default category.

.. note:: It is often more useful to have the plugin manager behave
          like singleton, this functionality is provided by
          ``PluginManagerSingleton``


Plugin Description Policy
=========================

When creating a ``PluginManager`` instance, one should provide it with
a list of directories where plugins may be found. In each directory,
a plugin should contain the following elements:

For a  *Standard* plugin:

  ``myplugin.yapsy-plugin`` 
 
      A *plugin info file* identical to the one previously described.
 
  ``myplugin``
 
      A directory ontaining an actual Python plugin (ie with a
      ``__init__.py`` file that makes it importable). The upper
      namespace of the plugin should present a class inheriting the
      ``IPlugin`` interface (the same remarks apply here as in the
      previous case).


For a *Single file* plugin:

  ``myplugin.yapsy-plugin`` 
       
      A *plugin info file* which is identified thanks to its extension,
      see the `Plugin Info File Format`_ to see what should be in this
      file.
   
      The extension is customisable at the ``PluginManager``'s
      instanciation, since one may usually prefer the extension to bear
      the application name.
  
  ``myplugin.py``
  
      The source of the plugin. This file should at least define a class
      inheriting the ``IPlugin`` interface. This class will be
      instanciated at plugin loading and it will be notified the
      activation/deactivation events.


Plugin Info File Format
-----------------------

The plugin info file gathers, as its name suggests, some basic
information about the plugin.

- it gives crucial information needed to be able to load the plugin

- it provides some documentation like information like the plugin
  author's name and a short description fo the plugin functionality.

Here is an example of what such a file should contain::

      [Core]
      Name = My plugin Name
      Module = the_name_of_the_pluginto_load_with_no_py_ending
         
      [Documentation]
      Description = What my plugin broadly does
      Author = My very own name
      Version = the_version_number_of_the_plugin
      Website = My very own website
      
      
 
.. note:: From such plugin descriptions, the ``PluginManager`` will
          built its own representations of the plugins as instances of
          the :doc:`PluginInfo` class.

Changing the default behaviour
==============================

The default behaviour for locating and loading plugins can be changed
using the various options exposed on the interface via getters.

The plugin detection, in particular, can be fully customized by
settting a custom plugin locator. See ``IPluginLocator`` for more
details on this.


Extensibility
=============

Several mechanisms have been put up to help extending the basic
functionalities of the proivided classes.

A few *hints* to help you extend those classes:

If the new functionalities do not overlap the ones already
implemented, then they should be implemented as a Decorator class of the
base plugin. This should be done by inheriting the
``PluginManagerDecorator``.

If this previous way is not possible, then the functionalities should
be added as a subclass of ``PluginManager``.

.. note:: The first method is highly prefered since it makes it
          possible to have a more flexible design where one can pick
          several functionalities and litterally *add* them to get an
          object corresponding to one's precise needs.
