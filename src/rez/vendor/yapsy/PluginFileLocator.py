Role
====

The ``PluginFileLocator`` locates plugins when they are accessible via the filesystem.

It's default behaviour is to look for text files with the
'.yapsy-plugin' extensions and to read the plugin's decription in
them.


Customization
-------------

The behaviour of a ``PluginFileLocator`` can be customized by instanciating it with a specific 'analyzer'.

Two analyzers are already implemented and provided here:

    ``PluginFileAnalyzerWithInfoFile``

        the default 'analyzer' that looks for plugin 'info files' as
        text file with a predefined extension. This implements the way
        yapsy looks for plugin since version 1.

    ``PluginFileAnalyzerMathingRegex``

        look for files matching a regex and considers them as being
        the plugin itself.

All analyzers must enforce the 

It enforces the ``plugin locator`` policy as defined by ``IPluginLocator`` and used by ``PluginManager``.

    ``info_ext``

        expects a plugin to be discovered through its *plugin info file*.
        User just needs to provide an extension (without '.') to look
        for *plugin_info_file*.

    ``regexp``

        looks for file matching the given regular pattern expression.
        User just needs to provide the regular pattern expression.

All analyzers must enforce the policy represented by the ``IPluginFileAnalyzer`` interface.
