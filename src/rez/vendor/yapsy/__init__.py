Overview
========

Yapsy's main purpose is to offer a way to easily design a plugin
system in Python, and motivated by the fact that many other Python
plugin system are either too complicated for a basic use or depend on
a lot of libraries. Yapsy only depends on Python's standard library.

|yapsy| basically defines two core classes:

- a fully functional though very simple ``PluginManager`` class

- an interface ``IPlugin`` which defines the interface of plugin
  instances handled by the ``PluginManager``


Getting started
===============

The basic classes defined by |yapsy| should work "as is" and enable
you to load and activate your plugins. So that the following code
should get you a fully working plugin management system::

   from rez.vendor.yapsy.PluginManager import PluginManager
   
   # Build the manager
   simplePluginManager = PluginManager()
   # Tell it the default place(s) where to find plugins
   simplePluginManager.setPluginPlaces(["path/to/myplugins"])
   # Load all plugins
   simplePluginManager.collectPlugins()

   # Activate all loaded plugins
   for pluginInfo in simplePluginManager.getAllPlugins():
      simplePluginManager.activatePluginByName(pluginInfo.name)


.. note:: The ``plugin_info`` object (typically an instance of
          ``IPlugin``) plays as *the entry point of each
          plugin*. That's also where |yapsy| ceases to guide you: it's
          up to you to define what your plugins can do and how you
          want to talk to them ! Talking to your plugin will then look
          very much like the following::

             # Trigger 'some action' from the loaded plugins
             for pluginInfo in simplePluginManager.getAllPlugins():
                pluginInfo.plugin_object.doSomething(...)

"""

__version__="1.10.323"

# tell epydoc that the documentation is in the reStructuredText format
__docformat__ = "restructuredtext en"

# provide a default named log for package-wide use
import logging
log = logging.getLogger('yapsy')

# Some constants concerning the plugins
PLUGIN_NAME_FORBIDEN_STRING=";;"
"""
.. warning:: This string (';;' by default) is forbidden in plugin
             names, and will be usable to describe lists of plugins
             for instance (see :doc:`ConfigurablePluginManager`)
"""

import re
def NormalizePluginNameForModuleName(pluginName):
	"""
	Normalize a plugin name into a safer name for a module name.
	
	.. note:: may do a little more modifications than strictly
	          necessary and is not optimized for speed.

	if len(pluginName)==0:
		return "_"
	if pluginName[0].isdigit():
		pluginName = "_" + pluginName
	return re.sub("\W","_",pluginName)
