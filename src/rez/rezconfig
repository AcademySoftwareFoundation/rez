#
# Rez configuration settings. Do not change this file.
#
# Settings are determined in the following way:
# 1) The setting is first read from this file;
# 2) The setting is then overridden if it is present in another settings file
#    pointed at by the $REZ_CONFIG_FILE environment variable;
# 3) The setting is further overriden if it is present in $HOME/.rezconfig;
# 4) The setting is overridden again if the environment variable $REZ_XXX is
#    present, where XXX is the uppercase version of the setting key. For example,
#    'image_viewer' will be overriden by $REZ_IMAGE_VIEWER.
# 5) This is a special case applied only during a package build or release. In
#    this case, if the package definition file contains a 'config' section,
#    settings in this section will override all others.
#
# Note that in the case of plugin settings (anything under the 'plugins'
# section of the config), (4) does not apply.
#
# Variable expansion can be used in configuration settings. The following
# expansions are supported:
# - Any property of the system object. Eg '{system.platform}'

# prevents unconfigured software from being used within the resolved environment.
# For example, if PYTHONPATH were to be appended to and not overwritten, then

# within the Rez environment.
# 'Parent variables' override this behaviour - they are appended/prepended to,
# rather than being overwritten. If you set 'all_parent_variables' to true, then
# all variables are considered parent variables, and the value of 'parent_variables'
