#
# Rez configuration settings. Do not change this file.
#
# Settings are determined in the following way:
# 1) The setting is first read from this file;
# 2) The setting is then overridden if it is present in another settings file
#    pointed at by the $REZ_SETTINGS_FILE environment variable;
# 3) The setting is further overriden if it is present in $HOME/.rezconfig;
# 4) The setting is overridden again if the environment variable $REZ_XXX is
#    present, where XXX is the uppercase version of the setting key. For example,
#    'image_viewer' will be overriden by $REZ_IMAGE_VIEWER.
# 5) This is a special case applied only during a package build or release. In
#    this case, if the package definition file contains a 'rezconfig' section,
#    settings in this section will override all others.
#
# If a setting type is a list, then an overriding env-var is expected to be
# separated by the path seperator for the current os (eg ':' in Linux), unless
# overridden in the '_sep' section.
#
# There are a set of special variables that will expand at runtime. These can be
# referred to by any string-based setting, using the format '{varname}'. The
# available variables are:
# {platform} - machine platform, eg 'linux';
# {arch} - machine architecture, eg 'x86_64';
# {os} - machine operating system, eg 'Ubuntu-12.04';
# {user} - the current user.

# Rez's default behaviour is to overwrite variables on first reference. This
# prevents unconfigured software from being used within the resolved environment.
# For example, if PYTHONPATH were to be appended to and not overwritten, then
# python modules from the parent environment would be (incorrectly) accessible
# within the Rez environment.
# 'Parent variables' override this behaviour - they are appended/prepended to,
# rather than being overwritten. If you set 'all_parent_variables' to true, then
# all variables are considered parent variables, and the value of 'parent_variables'
# is ignored. Be aware that if you make variables such as PATH, PYTHONPATH or
# app plugin paths parent variables, you are exposing yourself to potentially
# incorrect behaviour within a resolved environment.
