"""
A general resource system.

Use the classes in this file to create a resource system that supports
registering of resource classes, lazy validation of resource attributes, and
resource caching. You would not typically have users create `Resource` instances
directly; instead, some factory would be responsible for creating resources,
and would probably contain a `ResourcePool` to manage the resource instances.

Resources have attributes whos names match the entries in `Resource.schema`.
When a resource attribute is accessed for the first time, data validation (and
possibly conversion) is applied and cached. Resource data is also loaded lazily
- when the first attribute is accessed.

Resources themselves are also cached, according to the `cache_size` argument of
`ResourcePool`.

Use the `ResourceWrapper` class to implement classes that provide a public API
for a resource. This extra layer is useful because the same resource type may
be available from several sources or in different formats. In this situation
you can implement multiple `Resource` subclasses, but wrap them with a single
`ResourceWrapper` class.

Another reason to use `ResourceWrapper` is when you have attributes on your
`Resource` that don't require its data to be loaded - instead, some attributes
can be derived directly from the resource's variables. If you provide properties
in your resource wrapper for these attributes, then the unnecessary resource
data load is avoided.

See the 'pets' unit test in tests/test_resources.py for a complete example.

class Resource(object):
    """Abstract base class for a data resource.

    A resource is an object uniquely identified by a 'key' (the resource type),
    and a dict of variables. For example, a very simple banking system might
    have a resource type with key 'account.checking', and a single variable
    'account_owner' that uniquely identifies each checking account.

    Resources may have a schema, which describes the data associated with the
    resource. For example, a checking account might have a current balance (an
    integer) and a social security number (also an integer).

    Keys in a resource's schema are mapped onto the resource class. So a
    checking account instance 'account' would have attributes 'account.balance',
    'account.ssn' etc. Attributes are lazily validated, using the schema, on
    first access.

    A resource's data is loaded lazily, on first attribute access. This,
    combined with lazy attribute validation, means that many resources can be
    iterated, while potentially expensive operations (data loading, attribute
    validation) are put off as long as possible.

    Note:
        You can access the entire validated resource data dict using the
        `validated_data` function, and test full validation using `validate_data`.

    Attributes:
        key (str): Unique identifier of the resource type.
        schema (Schema): Schema for the resource data. Must validate a dict.
            Can be None, in which case the resource does not load any data.

            validation failure.
