The unit tests can be run in two different ways:


## rez-selftest

Via the "rez-selftest" cli tool. This will run the unit tests even if the current
environment is not configured for Rez (ie, Rez is not on PYTHONPATH). Useful
for running the tests even if the user is in a rez-env'd environment. Some
tests only run in this mode, since they rely on Rez being fully installed (and
its cli tools available within a resolved environment).


## python cli

Via direct invocation of unittest on the Python cli. This can be done either
directly on Rez's uninstalled source, or on an installed instance.

To run all tests from source:

```
]$ cd <rez source root>
]$ python -m unittest discover

To run a specific test once installed:
]$ python -m unittest rez.tests.test_solver
```
