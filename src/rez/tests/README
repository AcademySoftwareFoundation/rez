The unit tests can be run in two different ways:



rez-test
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Via the "rez-test" cli tool. This will run the unit tests even if the current
environment is not configured for Rez (ie, Rez is not on PYTHONPATH). Useful
for running the tests even if the user is in a rez-env'd environment. Some
tests only run in this mode, since they rely on Rez being fully installed (and
its cli tools available within a resolved environment).


python cli
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Via direct invocation of unittest/unittest2 on the Python cli. This can be done
either directly on Rez's uninstalled source, or on an installed instance.


Using Python-2.6:
-----------------
Python-2.6 comes with an earlier version of unittest that is not compatible with
Rez's unit tests. You need to install the 'unittest2' backport, which is
available here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2/0.5.1. To run the tests:

To run all tests from source:
]$ cd <rez source root>
]$ unit2 discover

To run a specific test once installed:
]$ unit2 rez.tests.test_solver



Using Python-2.7+:
------------------
Python-2.7 and greater contain a new unittest implementation that is compatible
with Rez's unit tests. To run the tests:

To run all tests from source:
]$ cd <rez source root>
]$ python -m unittest discover

To run a specific test once installed:
]$ python -m unittest rez.tests.test_solver
