def expand_requirement(request, paths=None):
    """Expands a requirement string like 'python-2.*', 'foo-2.*+<*', etc.

    Wildcards are expanded to the latest version that matches. There is also a
    special wildcard '**' that will expand to the full version, but it cannot
    be used in combination with '*'.

    Wildcards MUST placehold a whole version token, not partial - while 'foo-2.*'
    is valid, 'foo-2.v*' is not.

    Wildcards MUST appear at the end of version numbers - while 'foo-1.*.*' is
    valid, 'foo-1.*.0' is not.

    It is possible that an expansion will result in an invalid request string
    (such as 'foo-2+<2'). The appropriate exception will be raised if this
    happens.

    Examples:

        >>> print(expand_requirement('python-2.*'))
        python-2.7
        >>> print(expand_requirement('python==2.**'))
        python==2.7.12
        >>> print(expand_requirement('python<**'))
        python<3.0.5

    Args:
        request (str): Request to expand, eg 'python-2.*'

            defaults to `config.packages_path`.
