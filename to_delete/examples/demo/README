Run the script './run_demo'.

It sets the rez package search path and install path to ./build/published_packages, builds
and installs a set of packages, and then tests them. See './run_demo' for more details.

Some of the example packages in this demo (under ./packages) contain multiple versions.
These are analogous in the real world to multiple versions from a repository, such as svn
or git.
