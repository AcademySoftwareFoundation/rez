The directories in here are rez packages that expose some common third-party software to
the rez system, so they can be used by your own packages.

Each contains an 'ext' file somewhere. This should be changed into a symlink, pointing at
the relevant software on your system. The intent is that rez does not influence where you
actually have your 3rd party software installed... you might want this to be in a different
place to your rez packages.

Any 3rd party software that you need to add to rez but isn't here, should be reasonably
trivial to add. You just have to make the relevant dirs, symlink and files by hand
(package.yaml, and .cmake if it's a library). The user manual has instructions on how to
do this.

If you want to use any of these supplied packages, you just need to copy them into your
nominated package deployment directory (whos path will be listed in REZ_PACKAGES_PATH, and 
whos value was set by the "packages_path" entry in configure.sh), and then change 'ext' to 
a symlink as mentioned above.

Ideally sometime in the future there will be some kind of 'rez' file format, and a rez
package installer utility, for interfacing 3rd party software with rez more easily.
