## Details

### TSC Updates
* (AJ): 
    * First successful not-me release went out
    * Identified some kinks in the release process
    * Found some issues we need to fix in the release script
    * Nothing crazy, just removing some builtin assumptions
    * What was actually in it?
* (SM):
    * Some of Jasons updates to docs
    * Josh Kelly rez_used_local_resolve Context environment variable update
    * The rez config docstrings for package_filter
    * linter failure thing
    * nerdvegas replaced with aswf mentions
    * python scanning rezplugins issue
    * Brendans fix for pip packages issue
    * Thorstens environment variable appending issue
    * Other things not in the changelog that didn't change the code (markdown, github workfile files)
* (AJ):
    * Anything else on the governance.md?
* (JCM):
    * We are making progress, slower than we wished for
    * Some updates were pushed to it recently
    * Each TSC member has to review it and approve it
    * That has been a huge thing for us
* (SM): 
    * The governance thing mentions following contributing.md guidelines
    * As soon as gov.md is solved, we need to move on to contrib.md
    * The basics and skeleton are there
    * Just a few things to decide on like with branch naming and things like that
    * Actual decisions to make as opposed to copypasting other governance documents
* (AJ):
    * Also things like issue-making procedures
    * Should be top of list to tackle

### Windows pathing
* (AJ):
    * We wanted to discuss a longstanding PR for fixing gitbash related stuff
    * Where this started:
    * Awhile back we added shell support for Windows
    * The only shell that uses different assumptions than the platform it's actually running on
    * That exposed some assumptions in the existing codebase that weren't really valid anymore
    * Like appending paths to $PATH that git for windows was not happy with
    * I put in a feature that normalizes paths when you add to specific env vars that control the environment configuration
    * For those specific appended values, it would convert the path to a shell-specific form
    * The problem with that is that you only want that to happen in specific cases.
    * For all other cases you don't want that; you want the path-like variables to be platform-normalized and not shell-normalized, which the initial implementation did not handle.
    * I think we should have those two concepts implemented
    * Global configuration could have a set of environment variables by default to apply platform-normalization
    * By default we should do the cygpath-style stuff on Windows.
    * We have a variable that defines which path-like env vars we apply platform-normalization on to
    * And then for each shell can have optionally a different configuration.
    * May also make sense to be able to force it from a commands() section in a package if you need to for specific cases.
    * That's the overview off of the top of my head
* (JCM):
    * I think you summarized it correctly
    * The command section is also something I thought about a little and is a little bit unclear
    * But to me that would be the preferred way to go instead of having a global config although I understand why we need it
    * Since we don't want everyone to have to re-release their packages to adjust paths that need to be converted and things like that
    * One argument against having a broad normalization against all env vars is that we don't want to mess with variables that aren't supposed to be changed.
    * On linux nothing will change the content of your variables, which is a huge assumption, and would be really hard to debug, you would be searching for awhile to figure out that rez is what did the change.
    * That's why we kind of want having a manual way in the pkg-def that this is a path, and it's fine to apply normalization on this specific value.
* (AJ):
    * If we don't have it at all, we unintentionally expose specifics about the OS through the implementation of the commands.
    * Someone on Windows might write env.PATH.append with backslashes which is completely valid for them on Windows but which will of course break on Linux.
* (JCM):
    * That's where docs will be important.
    * It's been a problem forever.
    * If a studio is a linux house and decide to support Windows or whatever, nothing is gonna work
    * That's partly up to the studio, to properly write their package definitions with os.path.join and such
* (TK):
    * It's a place where documentation/best-practice and needs to properly explain the usage patterns
    * People struggle and tend to just hack it together until it works, since they are missing the docs
    * If they want to start on powershell and then move into using git-bash on top of powershell for example
    * It's very easy to do things in not-very-compatible ways
    * A lot of assumptions they make in their package.py may not be valid anymore
    * It might make sense for certain operations to trigger a warning on build
    * "Are you sure you want to use a string when appending a path" etc
* (JCM):
    * The manual way of saying "this is a path" in commands section, could open a door to adding warnings or things like that
* (AJ):
    * Can't quite only have that though, in the case of gitbash it also has to know about using colons to separate paths, 
    * So you kind of have to tell it explicitly how to concatenate multiple paths, you sort of have to configure it
    * Not sure how to get around that
* (SM):
    * Does it make sense to declare path normalization as a rez-config detail?
    * How do you handle it when multiple packages try to do different things with the normalization settings?
* (SE):
    * Good time to chime in
    * These are all things that I've been dealing with, that were brought up initially when I started working on this
    * It might be better to work backwards at this point because I have something work
    * We started linux and went to Windows
    * We've been using git-bash and have people using and testing it on both
    * A lot of these things being discussed were brought up before
    * I've taken a lot of these things into account
    * It might be better to just show what I've done and then work from there
    * (Demo)
    * Added two new variables:
    * pathed_env_vars = [] vs shell_pathed_env_vars = []
    * Here you can define which varaibles if any you want to be considered paths, or shell paths
    * For shell paths, on a per-shell basis, how you want it to work
    * This was also added into the config.py
    * In the shells there are now additional functions that support these
    * The concept of normalizing paths has been changed
    * Now you can return as path, as shell path, or normalize as you want
    * This allows you to not break backwards compatibility, but also gives you the option for how you want to automatically handle it going forward
    * For example in the gitbash plugin:
        * If you return something as a path, no transform occurs to it
        * If you return something as a shell path, there's a new function in Windows called convert_path
        * convert_path works based on the same principle as cygpath
            * Takes in a path, mode, force forward-slashes, supports unix pathing, mixed pathing, and windows pathing
            * And then there's functions to handle each of the types
            * handles converting drive letters and things like that for how you want to work with the paths
            * We can just return the paths how we need them based on how we define them
        * Any shell has access to these functions as they need it, but shells don't have to implement anything they don't want to
    * Additional code was added everywhere for how to handle and define implicit values so you don't get conversions on them
    * The rest of the code around how you use paths has been changed depending on whether it's being escaped or what type of path it is
    * Utilizing the things that were already there, working with them and making them compatible with both windows and linux.
* (JCM):
    * My main concern is user experience, I'd like to see how it looks in a package.py and the cases it currently handles, and the before/after.
    * Is it all magical at the moment and there is no control
* (SE):
    * It should all just be basically how you expect to build a package
    * If you're building it on linux, you'd just build it the same way you normally would
* (JS):
    * It's all in the rezconfig.py to declare which variables are which, right?
    * Should be an identical package config setup, it's just up to the config how to treat the variables differently
* (SE):
    * Yes, and that's the idea
    * The user shouldn't really have to think about whether or not they are building for Windows or Linux
    * They should just be able to do things the way they expect to do them, and just change how rez looks at it, at the end of the day, as simply as possible
* (JCM):
    * My main concern is about the magical approach,
    * How will the user know what to change as they use it and it's breaking
    * How will the user know that they can modify these settings to achieve what they want to
* (JS):
    * Devils advocate but isn't that most of any software? Most of configs?
    * There's a lot of stuff in the rez-config that if you take as vanilla and then later you realize you can change how something is being handled
    * They have to start digesting the config and possibilities anyway
* (SE):
    * I'd be more than happy to elaborate in documentation as opposed to just in the config
    * If we're giving people the option of doing these things, it's there, the rez-config does contain everything
    * And then you just choose what you want to use anyway
* (SM):
    * And the rez config gets generated into the doc system anyway
    * Side questions: Is it possible for us to have suitable-enough defaults that it's not going to need to be tweaked?
    * How close to perfect can we get to the base-case for a studio of all operating systems?
    * Is there a reasonable use-case scenario where different OS need to use different list of the pathed vs shell-pathed env vars? Any situation where that could arise?
* (SE):
    * In terms of the first question, what you're seeing right now could most likely be a reasonable default
    * In terms of operating system, I'm hard pressed to think of a shell that is available in every single operating system which would require something like this
    * git-bash not available outside of Windows, pwsh and cmd not available outside of Windows, 
* (Scattered):
    * pwsh is actually on Mac now too
* (TK):
    * Which is spefically the reason why we chose pwsh as a wrapper around rez
    * There are caveats not necessarily 100% identical across both OS
* (SM):
    * Critically though, Sam having described things the way they are, nothing would stop you from implementing your own pwsh equivalent to do the pathing you want to do right?
* (TK):
    * I would guess so
* (SE):
    * If you want to modify how shells behave, you can change the shell
    * There's nothing that forces you to do anything
    * Nothing inherits from shells, there's just these functions that do no transforms by default
    * So if you don't do anything, then you get no transformation, but if you decide to do something down the road, you can override any of these functions to do it the way gitbash shell is doing it
* (TK):
    * Currently I'm not sure if anybody does that,
    * But currently the pwsh plugin make quite a lot of assumptions and contain some references to Windows so I'm not sure if the plugin would work out of the box at that point
* (AJ):
    * Is it enabled on the tests actually?
* (TK):
    * I don't think it is, I think the pwsh plugin is only enabled on Windows
    * I think it has a check to only work on Windows
* (SE):
    * A lot a shells have this sort of thing
* (TK):
    * It's something I wanted to get to at some point
    * We're having a pwsh setup that wraps rez and deployment and install and config of rez
    * But the rez itself on linux uses bash and not pwsh and on Windows uses pwsh, but we're using pwsh around rez
    * I think it's confusing to support pwsh and not have it work on all platforms even though pwsh is available
* (AJ):
    * peek at pwsh real quick Sam? is it only enabled for Windows as well?
    * (It wasn't)
* (TK):
    * I would not bet that everything in these plugins works as expected
* (AJ):
    * That's an argument for beefing up the tests
* (SM):
    * I'm wondering if for any of the studios that have reps here, is there any chance we can get a test version of this deployed internally and see what problems we could possibly run into?
    * This is the kind of change we could go down the rabbithole of all day long but at the end of the day if the rubber is meeting the road for Method then how much further could it possibly need to go for Mackevision/Accenture etc
    * I'd be curious to see what kind of weirdest edge-cases we can find and just try to account for those as opposed to aiming for the perfect solution
    * 99% of users are going to be using it in a Windows-only env, a shared Win-Lin env, and the same defaults will probably just work for most people
    * If there's one config flag that will keep things working for acc/mv we should just do that
* (AJ):
    * Is there a setting to globally disable path normalization? We should definitely have that
* (SE):
    * I don't think so
    * There aren't that many places that use it within the shell
    * There is path normalization that happens outside of it
    * The only shells that were using it were gitbash and cmd
    * If we want a config global disable, I can add something in
* (AJ):
    * Big proponent of feature flags
    * As JC pointed out this could be a fairly difficult thing to debug
* (JCM):
    * I could see even logs in debug mode when you rez-env, could tell you which env vars were normalized etc
* (AJ):
    * Exactly same idea but different implementation...
    * For any path normalization that occurs, we should create a comment in the target shell script
    * If anyone looks at that with rez-context -i or whatever, there will be a full record of where it occurred
* (JCM):
    * I'd add the logs too because I don't really have the intuition to look into the shell scripts normally
    * We could put a comment in the shell
* (JS):
    * I agree with JC
    * I think a debug mode that is a very common non-rez methodology
    * To follow the config naming: normalize_none? debug_all, debug_none as config variables
    * Is that what you were thinking Allan?
* (AJ):
    * No, all that's just in logging - I would just called it disable_path_normalization, default False
    * Having any path normalization happening, a debug message should happen as well
* (JCM):
    * Should we consider how portable that will be?
    * I have issues with the config
    * portability - If it becomes more and more common to share rez packages, how would someone say that you need these set?
* (AJ):
    * That's a tricky one
* (JCM):
    * That's why I like the idea of going all-manual in the package.py files
    * And being up-front in docs and saying, when you write your package.py commands, make sure you use these commands, to be portabled etc
    * It's a bit more up-front and saves you sharing something and having the share-ee saying it doesn't work and realizing you forgot the config
* (SM):
    * I have a different take - I think the point of feature-flagging it - Would be simply to put it through it's paces  for a round or two or three
    * Once it's validated and made it a high-quality enough behavior, we simply remove the feature flag and enforce it once its been vetted sufficiently
    * It doesn't have to be a config flag forever, just long enough to get people on to a better quality path system eventually
    * Like once at least five Windows-using studios are using it successfully, we remove the flag
    * Don't we also have the means to specify a minimum rez version in a package.py?
    * If so, it will be possible to enforce that people are using a new enough rez to have been forced to use path normalization
* (AJ):
    * That does exist
* (SM):
    * I just remember it from the yaml-to-py migration
* (AJ):
    * We need to start, because there is a dependency between package and rez version
    * If we start using as_path and as_shell_path, there is a dependency
    * It would be best if we could determine from a package.py what the minimum version is, so that we could automate that
    * And set it on release packages
* (SM):
    * My point is that it's not necessary that we make this a package-level feature
* (JCM):
    * The commands is kind of already serialized into a custom format
    * Could use the ast module to parse it, check if the new custom functions for normalization are there, and then you can remove them or swap them or whatever.
    * Could be risky though and need a lot of testing for that kind of thing
* (AJ):
    * Something to consider for sure
* (TK):
    * I do feel the fear of having config dependenct features in package.pys
    * Kind of reminds me of the discussion in regards to pip_install_remaps where you have to change configs to install certain pips
    * That can be a really weird situation
    * And it should be the absolute exception in my opinion
    * And should only be required for the absolute edge-cases
* (JCM):
    * It creates problems if you have to modify your configuration every time
* (AJ):
    * Probably need some whole per-package configurations for pip things
* (JCM):
    * Or we make the decision that everything that isn't installed into the site-packages get shuffled into a random folder
* (AJ):
    * Were there not cases where those files were needed for the package to work?
* (JCM):
    * Yes but they aren't supposed to
* (TK):
    * There are but that's a bad practice and I would argue it shouldn't drive a design decision in rez
    * I would argue it's fine if we have the option to add these remaps and they would overwrite default behaviors
    * But it shouldn't be required to begin with
    * To get back to the original discussion:
        * If you have a dependency on a specific configuration that's not something that a developer can usually do because of centralized configuration
        * What we end up with is that every time a developer wants to install something we haven't done before that requires a remap,
        * They do that change locally, so every developer hits that same issue and they have to notify us to change the global config
        * It's really gotten a lot of a mess and creating a lot of friction for a lot of people
* (SM):
    * To be fair the entire rez-pip situation needs to get looked at
    * It's probably the globally biggest pain point
* (AJ):
    * Yeah that's just a hard thing to do isn't it, bridging entire packaging systems
* (SM):
    * Yeah, how do you make a portable package system interact with another without layering weird stuff on top
* (TK):
    * But I think in our case and true in both of these cases, it makes sense for us to make an opinionated default rather than have a required configuration
* (JCM):
    * It's a similar problem (although not to the same skill) we know that the environment variables, the most common ones like PATH, 
    * that has an effect where you need to enter a command and execute it right away
    * Supporting more than the PATH variable is basically supporting custom environment variable
    * If you have some crazy setup with bash wrappers and env vars and so on,
    * that person that does that they would have to modify the configuration for themselves as a corner-case
    * And the configuration wouldn't be changed that often or ever change unless I'm missing something
* (AJ):
    * Trying to think of edge-cases where you'd have an env var ending in PATH you wouldn't want to normalize WRT to the platform
* (JCM):
    * Sam's PR uses *PATH I think that would cover - Not comfortable with that - Too broad - Would like to know why that was used
    * In case that was to fix an actual issue or use-case you had
* (SE):
    * I can't remember - I think I saw something else doing that?
* (AJ):
    * Makes sense though doesn't it?
* (Scattered):
    * (naming PATH vars)
* (JCM):
    * PYTHONPATH doesn't have to be normalized
    * The python interpreter will be in the Windows world so the python import system will use the windows API
* (SM):
    * Not completely valid assumption because you could have a build system that might need to mangle the PYTHONPATH along the way
    * It might conflict with something making an assumption based on which world you're in, gitbash-y or Windows-y world
* (JCM):
    * Yeah that's the corner case I was talking about - It's quite rare
    * Normally every time a process accesses a variable it's a normal Windows process living its best life
* (SM):
    * If Method is using it with success is a pretty positive indicator because it was pretty complicated of a setup from what I remember.
    * I wonder about Thorstens use-cases and what things can be run into
* (TK):
    * I would definitely be up to taking the PR code and taking it into staging and have some people test it
    * A lot of this does not necessarily directly apply here and cmd is a lot easier to break
    * That said I can run a bunch of our setups through cmd and have a dev config for it instead
    * I think it might break in other places because in some places we assume pwsh for some special reasons (escaping in aliasing etc)
    * But I think that generally the approach is valid and happy to give it a test drive and not try to be perfect
* (SM):
    * Do we know any other Windows studios using rez?
* (TK):
    * It has come up a lot more recently because of Unreal and such, I can ask around
* (SM):
    * The PR sounds like it's testable, and while it would be good to have a flag and some logging it's mostly there
* (AJ):
    * Why don't we add the feature flag we talked about
    * Set it to false initially
    * Lets add the commenting and logging we talked about so that any normalization occuring creates a comment in the shell script
    * As well as printing a debug message
    * If we do all those things and then get approvals on that PR and fix up anything else that needs to be,
    * Does that sound like a plan that everyone is happy with?
* (JCM):
    * I'd like to see tests and more integration tests
    * So that we know that it's really working not just in unit tests
    * We test a rez-env and that executes stuff and even if they aren't complex scenarios, test that it actually works like it's supposed to
* (AJ):
    * I agree, there should be path-sensitive tests added,
    * Specifically that we know will run in gitbash in the tests
* (JCM):
    * I would also like - I don't know Sam if you kept the list - The issues you stumbled upon while developing it
    * But it could be a good idea to say here's all the cases you fixed
    * If you could list these cases it would help to expand the test cases later on, even if they aren't tested all right now
* (AJ):
    * Just in the interest of having smaller PRs
    * Would it be worth getting what Sam has now, setting the feature flag to false, merged, and then added tests/logging as separate PRs to follow?
    * Rather than everything to wrangle
* (SE):
    * The skip normalization is easy
    * Logging is kind of broken as a whole
    * Like I'm not sure logging is even initialized properly
    * Adding to debug log won't actually do anything even if I add the code in for it
* (AJ):
    * Cleaning up logging is a separate issue
* (SE):
    * Adding what you guys requested shouldn't be too difficult to do
    * I can 
* (SM):
    * Would it be easier to break it up into smaller PRs?
* (SE):
    * Up to your guys, the PR is pretty convoluted at this point due to all the discussions
    * I'd be fine making another PR because the change should be pretty obvious
* (SM):
    * As long as the feature flag ensures there's no default behavior change, then that's fine
* (SE):
    * Yeah none of that changes anything
* (TK):
    * One remark, we should have these types of changes emphasized in the release notes
    * So we can ask people specifically to go there and test it, noting that we may make it a default in future
    * So that we have input from more people outside this group
* (SM):
    * And highlight in Slack as well
* (JCM):
    * Before we finish I want to comment in the PR with all the things
    * Feature flag, off by default
    * Logging, add comments in shell script
    * Basic Tests for now
    * Notes for more tests later
* (SM):
    * My only concern is any parts that other people than Sam can contribute because it's a huge ask
* (JS):
    * I can help with the docs, Sam, when you get to that point
* (SE):
    * I appreciate any help I can get but whatever I need to do I'll do
    * I'd like this to be released and not immediately break but help appreciated
* (JCM):
    * I want to emphasize that I've been critical but I really appreciate what you did
    * And just trying to see what can be improved
* (SE):
    * I want this to be done right
    * The feedback has helped it be done better
    * We're all on the same team, same goal
    * I appreciate the help and feedback, it's all going to the right place
* (TK):
    * There's gonna be a lot of people appreciating the work here because a lot of developers would like to use gitbash
* (AJ):
    * More than just gitbash even
* (SM):
    * I'm frankly even just happy I'll be able to use rez better at home, it's been rough sometimes
    * Hope I can throw a few tests at the wall here
* (AJ):
    * poetry doesn't even work on gitbash, so we're doing pretty well
* (SM):
    * Thanks Sam for doing the walkthrough
* (AJ):
    * Thanks Sam, thanks everyone
