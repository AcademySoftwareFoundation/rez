Rez is a cross-platform package manager with a difference. Using Rez you can create
standalone environments configured for a given set of packages. However, unlike many
other package managers, packages are not installed into these standalone environments.
Instead, all package versions are installed into a central repository, and standalone
environments reference these existing packages. This means that configured environments
are lightweight, and very fast to create, often taking just a few seconds to configure
despite containing hundreds of packages.

Traditional package manager:

Rez takes a list of package requests, and constructs the target environment, resolving
all the necessary package dependencies. Any type of software package is supported -
compiled, python, applications and libraries.
