Plugins
=======

Rez is designed around the concept of plugins. Plugins can be used to extend rez's functionalities without modifying any of rez's source code.

Rez comes with built-in plugins that are located at :gh-rez:`src/rezplugins`. New plugins are encouraged to be developed out-of-tree (outside rez).

This page documents what plugins are available, the plugin types and how plugins are discovered.
If you want to learn how to develop a plugin, please refer to :doc:`guides/developing_your_own_plugin`.

.. _configuring-plugins:

Configuring plugins
===================

Plugins can be configured by adding a ``plugins`` key to your ``rezconfig.py``
like this:

.. code-block:: python

   plugins = {
       "package_repository": {
           "filesystem": {}
       }
   }

List installed plugins
======================

Currently installed plugins can be queried by running :option:`rez -i`

.. code-block:: console

   $ rez -i

Discovery mechanisms
====================

There are three different discovery mechanisms for external/out-of-tree plugins:

#. :ref:`rezplugins-structure`
#. :ref:`plugin-entry-points`

Each of these mechanisms can be used independently or in combination. It is up to you to
decide which discovery mechanism is best for your use case. Each option has pros and cons.

.. _rezplugins-structure:

``rezplugins`` structure
------------------------

This method relies on the ``rezplugins`` namespace package. Use the :data:`plugin_path` setting or
the :envvar:`REZ_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable to tell rez where to find your plugin(s).

You need to follow the following file structure:

.. code-block:: text

   rezplugins/
   ├── __init__.py
   └── <plugin_type>/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── <plugin name>.py

``<plugin_type>`` refers to types defined in the :ref:`plugin types <plugin-types>` section. ``<plugin_name>`` is the name of your plugin.
The ``rezplugins`` directory is not optional.

.. note::
    The path(s) MUST point to the directory **above** your ``rezplugins`` directory.

.. note::
   Even though ``rezplugins`` is a python package, your sparse copy of
   it should  not be on the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, just the :envvar:`REZ_PLUGIN_PATH`.
   This is important  because it ensures that rez's copy of
   ``rezplugins`` is always found first.

.. _plugin-entry-points:

Entry-points
------------

.. versionadded:: 3.3.0

Plugins can be discovered by using `Python's entry-points <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/#using-package-metadata>`_.

There is one entry-point per :ref:`plugin type <plugin-types>`:

* ``rez.plugins.build_process``
* ``rez.plugins.build_system``
* ``rez.plugins.command``
* ``rez.plugins.package_repository``
* ``rez.plugins.release_hook``
* ``rez.plugins.release_vcs``
* ``rez.plugins.shell``

This allows a package to define multiple plugins. In fact, a package can contain multiple plugins of the same type and plugins for multiple types.

.. note::
   Unlike the other discovery mechanisms, this method doesn't require any special file structure. It is thus more flexible, less restricting
   and easier to use.

.. _default-settings:

Default settings
----------------

You can define default settings for the plugins you write by adding a ``rezconfig.py`` or ``rezconfig.yml``
beside your plugin module. Rez will automatically load these settings.

This is valid both all the discovery mechanisms.

Note that the format of that ``rezconfig.py`` or ``rezconfig.yml`` file is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   top_level_setting = "value"

   plugin_name = {
       "setting_1": "value1"
   }

In this case, the settings for ``plugin_name`` would be available in your plugin as ``self.settings``
and ``top_level_setting`` would be available as ``self.type_settings.top_level_setting``.

.. note::

   Not all plugin types support top level settings. Please refer to the table in :ref:`plugin-types` to
   see which types support them.

Overriding built-in plugins
===========================

Built-in plugins can be overridden by installing a plugin with the same name and type.
When rez sees this, it will prioritie your plugin over its built-in plugin.

This is useful if you want to modify a built-in plugin without having to modify rez's source code.
