Introduction
------------

Rez is a cross-platform, LGPL Licensed python library and set of utilities for building and installing packages, and resolving environments containing these packages at runtime, avoiding version conflicts. The main tools are:

-  **rez-env** - Creates a configured shell containing a set of requested packages. Supports **bash** and **tcsh**, and mimics the startup sequences of the native shell.

-  **rez-build** - Builds a package of any type (python, C++ etc), and installs it locally for testing. Supports **cmake**.

-  **rez-release** - Builds and centrally deploys a package, and updates the associated source control repository (creating tags etc). Supports **git**, **mercurial** and **svn**.

Unlike many packaging systems, Rez is able to install many different versions of the same packages. When you use the rez-env tool, a new environment is dynamically created, containing the requested packages. Rez resolves environments at runtime, rather than install time - however, you are able to store a resolve to disk, and reuse it at a later date.

Here's an example which places the user into a resolved shell containing the requested packages:

::

    ]$ rez-env requests-2.2+ python-2.6 'pymongo-0+<2.7'
    
    You are now in a rez-configured environment.

    implicit packages:
    platform-linux
    arch-x86_64
    
    requested packages:
    requests-2.2+
    python-2.6
    pymongo-0+<2.7
    
    resolved packages:
    python-2.6.8    /software/ext/python/2.6.8
    platform-linux  /software/ext/platform/linux
    requests-2.2.1  /software/ext/requests/2.2.1/python-2.6
    pymongo-2.6.3   /software/ext/pymongo/2.6.3
    arch-x86_64     /software/ext/arch/x86_64
    
    > ]$ _

Here's an example which creates an environment containing the package 'houdini' version 12.5 or greater, and runs the command 'hescape -h' inside that environment:

::

    ]$ rez-env -c 'hescape -h' houdini-12.5+
    Usage: hescape [-foreground] [-s editor] [filename ...]
    -h: output this usage message
    -f: force the use of asset definitions in OTL files on the command line
    -s: specify starting desktop by name
    -foreground: starts process in foreground

Resolved environments can also be created programmatically:

::

    >>> from rez.resolved_context import ResolvedContext
    >>>
    >>> r = ResolvedContext(["houdini-12.5+", "houdini-0+<13", "java", "!java-1.8+"])
    >>>
    >>> r.print_info()

    implicit packages:
    platform-linux
    arch-x86_64
    
    requested packages:
    houdini-12.5+
    houdini-0+<13
    java
    
    resolved packages:

    arch-x86_64       /software/ext/arch/x86_64
    houdini-12.5.562  /software/ext/houdini/12.5.562
    >>>
    >>> import subprocess
    >>> p = r.execute_shell(command='which hescape', stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout,stderr = p.communicate()
    >>>
    >>> print stdout
    '/software/ext/houdini/12.5.562/bin/hescape'

Features
--------

-  Supports Linux and OSX;
-  Allows for a fast and efficient build-install-test cycle;
-  Creates shells of type: bash, tcsh, other (shells can be added as plugins);
-  Contains a deployment system supporting git, mercurial and svn (as plugins);
-  Environment resolves can be saved to disk and reused at a later date (a bit like VirtualEnv);
-  Highly pluggable, supports five different plugin types to do things from adding new shell types, to adding new build systems;
-  Contains a version resolving algorithm, for avoiding version clashes;
-  Visualises resolved environments in a rendered dot-graph;
-  Packages are found in a search path, so different packages can be deployed to different locations;
-  Supports alphanumeric version numbers;
-  Has a powerful version requirements syntax, able to describe any version range, and a conflict operator for rejecting version ranges;
-  Package 'variants' - a way to define different flavors of the same package version, for example a plugin built for multiple versions of the host app;
-  Custom release hooks (such as post-release operations) can be added as plugins;
-  Has a time lock feature, which allows old resolves to be recreated (newer packages are ignored);
-  Package definitions are a single, succinct file;
-  Packages define their effect on the environment (adding to PATH etc) in a platform- and shell- agnostic way, using a dedicated python API;
-  Has a memcached-based caching system, for caching environment resolves.


Installation
------------

To install Rez, simply:

::

    pip install rez

Or, to install from source:

::

    python setup.py install

To see that it's working:

::

    ]$ rez-env -c 'hello_world' hello_world
    Hello Rez World!
