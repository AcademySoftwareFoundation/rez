# Rez Project Roles and Responsibilities

Rez is a project of the Academy Software Foundation and relies on
the ASWF governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation.

There are three primary project roles: 

* [Contributors](#Contributors) submit code to the project
* [Committers](#Committers) approve code to be included into the project
* [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](#Technical-Steering-Committee) 
  members provide overall high-level project guidance.


## Contributors

The Rez project grows and thrives from assistance from
Contributors. Contributors include anyone in the community that
submits code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the
project. However, such contributions must be approved by a project
Committer before they become a part of the project.  

Anyone can be a Contributor. You need no formal approval from the
project, beyond the legal forms.

### How to Become a Contributor

* Review the coding standards in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ensure your contribution
  is in line with the project's coding and styling guidelines.

* Sign the Individual CLA, or have your organization sign the Corporate CLA.

* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off.

## Committers

Project Committers have merge access on the Rez GitHub repository
and are responsible for approving submissions by Contributors.

### Committer Responsibilities

Typical activities of a Committer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors.

* Ensuring a response to questions posted to the ASWF rez slack channel.

* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project.

* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests.

* Ensuring that changes and new code meet acceptable standards and are
  in the long-term interest of the project.

* Participation in working groups.

* Merging pull requests.

### How to Become a Committer

Any existing Committer can nominate an individual making significant
and valuable contributions to the Rez project to become a new
Committer. New committers are approved by vote of the TSC.

If you are interested in becoming a Committer, contact the TSC via:
  rez-discussion@lists.aswf.io,
  or privately on the AcademySoftwareFoundation Slack instance.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) oversees the overall technical
direction of Rez, as defined in the project
[charter](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/foundation/blob/main/project_charters/rez-charter.pdf).
This charter defines the TSC member terms and succession policies.

The responsibilities of the TSC include:

* Coordinating technical direction of the project.

* Project governance and contribution policy.

* GitHub repository administration.

* Maintaining the list of additional Committers.

* Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open
  standards communities.

* Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on
  technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple
  projects.

* Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the
  project.

The TSC elects a Chair person, who acts as the project manager,
organizing meetings and providing oversight to project
administration. The Chair is elected by the TSC. The Chair will
also serve as the Rez representative on the Academy Software
Foundation (ASWF) Technical Advisory Council (TAC). The chair may
delegate or reclaim any portion of these responsibilities to or
from other TSC members on a short or long-term basis.

### Current TSC Members

Members of the TSC contribute to rez independent of their employer and
their employer is listed purely for transparency purposes.

* Brendan Abel - Walt Disney Imagineering
* Jean-Christophe Morin (co-chair) - Anaconda
* Stephen Mackenzie (co-chair) - NVIDIA
* Thorsten Kaufmann - Accenture Song Content

Changes to employment should be updated promply and will require a pull request.
Such pull requests do not require an approval from all members.

### Former TSC Members

* Allan Johns (author and initial chair)

### TSC Meetings

All meetings of the TSC are open to participation by any member of the
Rez community. Meeting times are listed in the [rez project calendar](https://lists.aswf.io/g/rez-discussion/calendar). The TSC
Chair moderates the meeting, or appoints another TSC member to
moderate in his or her absence.

Items are added to the TSC agenda which are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, TSC membership,
or release process, in addition to topics involving the high-level
technical direction of the project.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all
patches. That should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by
the larger group of Committers.

Any community member or Contributor can ask that something be reviewed
by the TSC at the meeting by logging a GitHub issue. Any Committer,
TSC member can bring the issue to the TSC's
attention by applying the `TSC` label.

Prior to each TSC meeting, a TSC member will share the agenda with members
of the TSC. TSC members can also add items to the agenda at the beginning
of each meeting. The meeting chair and the TSC cannot veto or remove items.
The agenda will also be shared on Slack in the #rez channel, preferably a
day before if possible.

The TSC may invite additional persons to participate in a non-voting capacity.

The meeting chair and secretary are responsible for archiving the
[minutes](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/tree/master/ASWF/TSC/meeting-notes).

Due to the challenges of scheduling a global meeting with participants
in several time zones, the TSC will seek to resolve as many agenda
items as possible outside of meetings through Github Issues and Discussions,
and through the #rez ASWF slack channel.
