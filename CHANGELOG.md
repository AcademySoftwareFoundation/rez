CMake no longer uses the `-d` arg to specify the directory in which to find CMakeLists.txt. This appears
to be incompatible with newer cmake versions, but (happily) dropping it in older versions also appears
compatible.

**Notes**

This release uses python-3's native `venv` module to perform the rez installation, for python-3.7 and above.
For earlier python versions, an embedded copy of virtualenv was used, but this ceases to work correctly in
python-3.9.

[Source](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/tree/2.71.0) | [Diff](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/compare/2.70.5...2.71.0)

**Notes**

[Ephemeral packages](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/wiki/Ephemeral-Packages) are a major new feature. These
enable dependencies on abstract objects or machine capabilities (for example), and also act as a way to pass
'options' to packages that can alter their behaviour. These will also form the basis for _package features_, an
upcoming feature that will allow packages to depend on _features_ of other packages, rather than just their
version number.

**Backwards Compatibility Issues**

This release **removes the bez build system**. This was a very simple build system that does nothing more
than call a function in `rezbuild.py`, passing it some build attributes (such as installation path). It has
been removed because you can achieve the same thing using a custom build command, and you can retrieve the
build attributes from environment variables instead.

If you attempt to build a package that was previously using bez (ie, the `rezbuild.py` script is still there,
and `build_command` is not specified in your package.py) then the resulting error message shows you what you
need to do to port your existing build script.

**Merged pull requests:**

**Backwards Compatibility Issues**

Note that this release changes OS detection on linux. The results _should_ be the same, but if they
do differ, and you need to retain the same OS name (which you probably will, because you'll have
packages that depend on the analogous implicit package), then you can use the
[platform_map](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/wiki/Configuring-Rez#platform_map) setting.

- Replace platform.linux_distribution by distro [\#954](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/954) ([predat](https://github.com/predat))

[Source](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/tree/2.60.0) | [Diff](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/compare/2.59.1...2.60.0)

**Backwards Compatibility Issues**

Please note that #887 introduces a subtle change to CLI behaviour. Previously, `rez-context --resolve`
would print a space-separated list of packages, even when piped to another process. Now however, if
the output is piped, it will print one package per line. This is an improvement, as it means you can
more easily chain `rez-context` with other utilities such as grep, xargs etc.

**Merged pull requests:**

- added get_variant_from_uri functionality [\#886](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/886) ([nerdvegas](https://github.com/nerdvegas))

[Source](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/tree/2.47.14) | [Diff](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/compare/2.47.13...2.47.14)

**Notes**

Several Windows CI improvements:
* Base and Py docker images are only rebuilt if necessary;
* Docker hub no longer requires a login to pull the image (meaning that tests now pass on forked PRs);
* Rather than checking out the rez github repo in the image entrypoint, the existing checkout (done
  by the workflow) is bind mounted instead.

With these updates, tests are now passing on all platforms.

**Known Issues**

If the image is changed, there is a delay in the new image becoming available on docker hub (5-10 mins).
If a separate push is made in this time, it can fail, as the Windows test expects to see the new image
(which is tagged by commit).

**Merged pull requests:**

- Windows docker enhancements [\#794](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/794) ([bfloch](https://github.com/bfloch))
- Remove the login so that PR work at least for the non-image workflows. [\#795](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/795) ([bfloch](https://github.com/bfloch))

**Notes**

This release just makes some minor changes related to the CI tests. As well as the changes in the PR shown
below, the following changes were also made:

* 'Windows Docker' workflow was renamed 'Windows'
* MacOS version used in workflow was changed from 10.14 to 'latest', as per Github's instructions (which were
  emailed to me).

[Source](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/tree/2.47.12) | [Diff](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/compare/2.47.11...2.47.12)

**Notes**

This release adds a docker-based workflow for the Github Actions Windows test. This was done specifically
because Github's available Windows runtimes come with an already long %PATH%. Rez adds to PATH and hits
a limit, causing the `cmd` shell to fail in several tests.

**Notes**

* GitHub Actions CI test suite added
* Windows not passing currently, fixes to come
* Note that pwsh shell implementation was using the subprocess 'universal_newlines' arg - this has been
  removed. This was causing `execute_shell` to return an str-type stdout/stderr tuple, rather than
  bytes as every other shell impl does, and this was causing tests to fail.

**Notes**

Last round of Py3 updates (not counting further bugfixes found from testing).

Please take note if you notice any changes in performance in Py2. This release includes a number of changes
from methods like `iteritems` to `items`, which in Py2 means a list construction rather than just an iterator.
Tests have shown performance to be identical, but you may find a case where it is not.

[Source](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/tree/2.40.2) | [Diff](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/compare/2.40.1...2.40.2)

**Notes**

This release fixes an issue on Windows, which has non-case-sensitive filepaths. Requesting a package with a case
differing from that on disk would cause two packages to exist in the resolve, which really were just different
cases of the same package.

The behaviour on Windows is now:

- Packages are case-sensitive - `rez-env Foo` will fail if the package folder on disk is `foo`;
- Package repository paths are case-insensitive - `~/packages` and `~/Packages` are regarded as the same repo.

* scripts have been removed, and entry points are used instead;
* install.py code has been cleaned up and simplified. Specifically, standard use of
  distlib.ScriptMaker has been put in place;
* INSTALL.md has been updated with a full explanation of the installer, and why a
  pip-based installation is not the same as using install.py.

## 2.26.4 [[#562](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/562)] Fixed Regression in 2.24.0

#### Addressed Issues

* [#561](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/561) timestamp not written to installed package


## 2.26.3 [[#560](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/560)] Package.py permissions issue

#### Addressed Issues

* [#559](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/559) package.py permissions issue

#### Notes

Fixes issue where installed `package.py` can be set to r/w for only the current user.


## 2.26.2 [[#557](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/557)] Package Copy Fixes For Non-Varianted Packages

#### Addressed Issues

* [#556](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/556) rez-cp briefly copies original package definition in non-varianted packages
* [#555](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/555) rez-cp inconsistent symlinking when --shallow=true
* [#554](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/554) rez-cp doesn't keep file metadata in some cases

#### Notes

There were various minor issues related to copying non-varianted packages.


## 2.26.1 [[#552](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/552)] Bugfix in Package Copy

#### Addressed Issues

* [#551](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/551) package copy fails if symlinks in root dir

#### Notes

This was failing when symlinks were present within a non-varianted package being copied. Now, these
symlinks are retained in the target package, unless `--follow-symlinks` is specified.


## 2.26.0 [[#550](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/550)] Build System Detection Fixes

#### Addressed Issues

* [#549](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/549) '--build-system' rez-build option not always
  available

#### Notes

To fix this issue:
* The '--build-system' rez-build option is now always present.
* To provide further control over the build system type, the package itself can now specify its build
  system - see https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/wiki/Package-Definition-Guide#build_system

#### COMPATIBILITY ISSUE!

Unfortunately, the 'cmake' build system had its own '--build-system' commandline option also. This
was possible because previous rez versions suppressed the standard '--build-system' option if only
one valid build system was present for a given package working directory. **This option has been
changed to '--cmake-build-system'**.


## 2.25.0 [[#548](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/pull/548)] Various Build-related issues

#### Addressed Issues

* [#433](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/433): "package_definition_build_python_paths" defined
  paths are not available from top level in package.py
* [#442](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/442): "rez-depends" and "private_build_requires"
* [#416](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/416): Need currently-building-variant build variables
* [#547](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/issues/547): rez-cp follows symlinks within package payload

#### Notes

The biggest update in this release is the introduction of new variables accessible at early-bind time:
building, build_variant_index and build_variant_requires. This allows you to do things like define
different private_build_requires per-variant, or a requires that is different at runtime than it is
at build time. In order to get this to work, a package.py is now re-evaluated multiple times when a
build occurs - once pre-build (where 'building' is set to False), and once per variant build. Please
see the updated wiki for more details: https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/wiki/Package-Definition-Guide#available-objects

A new build-time env-var, REZ_BUILD_VARIANT_REQUIRES, has been added. This mirrors the new
build_variant_requires var mentioned above.

rez-depends has been updated to only include the private_build_requires of the package being queried
(previously, all packages' private build reqs were included, which is not useful). Recall that the
previous release fixes the issue where private_build_requires was being stripped from released
packages.

The entirety of a package definition file can now see the extra build-time modules available via the
package_definition_build_python_paths config setting. Previously, only early bound functions could
see these.

There was an issue with package copying (and thus the rez-cp tool) where symlinks within a package's
payload were expanded out to their source files at copy time. The default now is to keep such symlinks
intact - but hte previous behavior can still be accessed with the rez-cp --follow-symlinks option.


## 2.24.0: Package Copying

This release adds a new tool, rez-cp, for copying packages/variants from one package repository to
another, with optional renaming/reversioning. The associated API can be found in src/package_copy.py.

#### Addressed Issues

* #541
* #510
* #477

#### Notes

* Package definition file writes are now atomic;
* private_build_requires is kept in installed/released packages;
* Fixes include modules not being copied into released packages;
* File lock is no longer created when variant installation happens in dry mode.


## 2.23.1: Fixed Regression in 2.20.0

#### Addressed Issues

* #532

#### Notes

Bug was introduced in: https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/releases/tag/2.20.0


## 2.23.0: Package Usage Tracking, Better Config Overrides

#### Addressed Issues

* #528

#### Notes

Two new features are added in this release:

Override any config setting with an env-var. For any setting "foo", you can now set the env-var
REZ_FOO_JSON to a JSON-encoded string. This works for any config setting. Note that the existing
REZ_FOO env-var overrides are still in place also; if both are defined, REZ_FOO takes precedence.
This feature means you can now override some of the more complicated settings with env-vars, such as
package_filter.

Track context creation and sourcing via AMQP. Messages are published (on a separate thread) to the
nominated broker/exchange/routing_key. You have control over what parts of the context are published.
For more details: https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez/blob/master/src/rez/rezconfig.py#L414

The embedded simplejson lib was removed. The native json lib is used instead, and for cases where loads-without-unicoding-everything is needed, utils/json.py now addresses that instead.


## 2.22.1: Stdin-related fixes

#### Addressed Issues

* #512
* #526


## 2.22.0: Search API

PR: #213

#### Notes

Package/variant/family search API is now available in package_search.py. This gives the same
functionality as provided by the rez-search CLI tool.


## 2.21.0: Added mingw as a rez build_system for cmake

PR: #501


## 2.20.1: Windows Fixes

#### Merged PRs

* #490: Fix alias command in Windows when PATH is modified
* #489: Fix cmd.exe not escaping special characters
* #482: Fix selftest getting stuck on Windows

#### Addressed Issues

* #389
* #343
* #432
* #481


## 2.20.0: Better CLI Arg Parsing

PR: #523

#### Addressed Issues

* #492

#### Notes

The rez-python command now supports all native python args and passes those through to its python
subprocess - so you can now shebang with rez-python if that is useful.

More broadly, rez commands now parse CLI args correctly for each case. Many commands previously
accepted rez-env-style commands (eg rez-env pkgA -- somecommand -- i am ignored), but simply ignored
extraneous args after -- tokens.


## 2.19.1: Fixed bug with rez-build and package preprocess

#### Merged PRs

* #522

#### Addressed Issues

* #514

#### Notes

The problem occurred because the preprocess function was attempting to be serialized when the package
definition is cached to memcache. However, this function is stripped in installed packages;
furthermore, caching "developer packages" (ie unbuilt packages) was never intentional.

This release disables memcaching of developer packages, thus avoiding the bug and bringing back
originally intended behavior.
